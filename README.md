# CHOICE-PUF
CHOICE, is a novel class of FPGA-based PUF designs with tunable uniqueness and reliability characteristics. By the use of addressable shift registers available on an FPGA, CHOICE provides a wide configuration space for adjusting a device-specific PUF response without sacrificing randomness. CHOICE can be used to design, prototype, and evaluate different PUF configurations by a hardware/software co-design on Xilinx Zynq Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC) architectures.

A [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330728498_Model-Based_Design_Automation_of_HardwareSoftware_Co-Designs_for_Xilinx_Zynq_PSoCs) about CHOICE was presented at the [2021 International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/fpl2021/welcome-to-fpl2021).
