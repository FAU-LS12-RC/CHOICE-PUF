# CHOICE-PUF
CHOICE, is a novel class of FPGA-based PUF designs with tunable uniqueness and reliability characteristics. By the use of addressable shift registers available on an FPGA, CHOICE provides a wide configuration space for adjusting a device-specific PUF response without sacrificing randomness.
